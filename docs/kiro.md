# Kiro CLI (Default Agent)

Kiro CLI is the default agent backend for OpenAB. It supports ACP natively — no adapter needed.

## Docker Image

The default `Dockerfile` bundles both `openab` and `kiro-cli`:

```bash
docker build -t openab:latest .
```

## Helm Install

```bash
helm repo add openab https://openabdev.github.io/openab
helm repo update

helm install openab openab/openab \
  --set agents.kiro.discord.botToken="$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" \
  --set-string 'agents.kiro.discord.allowedChannels[0]=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID'
```

## Manual config.toml

```toml
[agent]
# command and args default from OPENAB_AGENT_COMMAND="kiro-cli acp --trust-all-tools"
# Only override if you need non-default behavior
```

## Authentication

Kiro CLI requires a one-time OAuth login. The PVC persists tokens across pod restarts.

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/openab-kiro -- sh -c "$OPENAB_AGENT_AUTH_COMMAND"
```

Follow the device code flow in your browser, then restart the pod:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/openab-kiro
```

### Persisted Paths (PVC)

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `~/.kiro/` | Settings, skills, sessions |
| `~/.local/share/kiro-cli/` | OAuth tokens (`data.sqlite3` → `auth_kv` table), conversation history |

## Default Agent Resources

When Kiro CLI starts with the built-in `kiro_default` agent, it automatically reads the following resources into context:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent coordination file (if exists in working dir) |
| `README.md` | Project readme (if exists in working dir) |
| `.kiro/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill files (local and global `~/.kiro/skills/`) |
| `.kiro/steering/**/*.md` | Steering docs (local and global, if exists) |
| `AmazonQ.md` | Legacy prompt file (if exists in working dir) |

> **Highly recommended:** `AGENTS.md` and `.kiro/steering/**/*.md` are the primary ways to give Kiro persistent memory. If you need Kiro to "memorize" something — best practices, guidelines, operational procedures, or project conventions — always first consider these two locations:
>
> - **`AGENTS.md`** — Place in the agent's working directory (default: `/home/agent`). Ideal for identity, role definition, and top-level instructions.
> - **`.kiro/steering/**/*.md`** — Organize guidelines by topic, e.g.:
>   - `.kiro/steering/operations/backup.md` — backup procedures
>   - `.kiro/steering/coding/style.md` — code style rules
>   - `.kiro/steering/security/secrets.md` — secret handling policy
>
> Both are read into context on every session start — no extra configuration needed.

### Customizing the Default Agent

You can override the default agent by creating a custom agent config:

```bash
# Inside the pod or on the PVC
cat > ~/.kiro/agents/my-agent.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "my-agent",
  "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
  "tools": ["*"],
  "resources": [
    "file://AGENTS.md",
    "file://README.md",
    "skill://.kiro/skills/**/SKILL.md"
  ]
}
EOF

# Set as default
kiro-cli settings chat.defaultAgent my-agent
```

## Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `/models` | Switch AI model | ✅ Implemented |
| `/agents` | Switch agent mode | ✅ Implemented |
| `/cancel` | Cancel current generation | ✅ Implemented |

### `/models` — Switch AI Model

Kiro CLI returns available models via ACP `configOptions` (category: `"model"`) on session creation. User types `/models` in a thread → select menu appears → pick a model → OpenAB sends `session/set_config_option` (falls back to `/model <value>` prompt if not supported).

### `/agents` — Switch Agent Mode

Same mechanism as `/models` but for the `agent` category. Kiro CLI exposes modes like `kiro_default` and `kiro_planner` via `configOptions`.

### `/cancel` — Cancel Current Operation

Sends a `session/cancel` JSON-RPC notification to abort in-flight LLM requests and tool calls. Works immediately — no need to wait for the current response to finish.

**Note:** All slash commands only work in threads where a conversation is already active. If no session exists, they will prompt the user to start one first.

See [docs/slash-commands.md](slash-commands.md) for full details.

## Built-in Kiro CLI Commands

All built-in kiro-cli slash commands can be passed directly after an @mention:

```
@MyBot /compact
@MyBot /clear
@MyBot /model claude-sonnet-4
```

These are forwarded as-is to the kiro-cli ACP session as a prompt. Any command that kiro-cli supports in its interactive mode works here.
