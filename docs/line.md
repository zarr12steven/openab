# LINE Setup


> **Unified Mode (v0.9.0+):** The OAB binary now embeds the line adapter directly. Set `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` as an env var — no separate gateway container or `[gateway]` config needed. See [Telegram docs](telegram.md#unified-mode-recommended) for the pattern.

### Unified Config (Kiro + line)

**Minimal:**

```toml
[agent]
env = { KIRO_API_KEY = "${KIRO_API_KEY}" }
```

**Recommended:**

```toml
[agent]
env = { KIRO_API_KEY = "${KIRO_API_KEY}" }

[pool]
max_sessions = 3
session_ttl_hours = 1

[reactions]
tool_display = "compact"

[markdown]
tables = "off"
```

Set `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` (and related platform env vars) on the container. No `[gateway]` needed.


Connect a LINE bot to OpenAB via the Custom Gateway.

```
LINE ──POST──▶ Gateway (:8080) ◀──WebSocket── OAB Pod
                                   (OAB connects out)
```

## Prerequisites

- A running OAB instance (with kiro-cli or any ACP agent authenticated)
- The Custom Gateway deployed ([gateway/README.md](../gateway/README.md))
- A LINE Official Account with Messaging API enabled

## 1. Create a LINE Official Account

1. Go to [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz) and create a new account
2. After creation, go to **Settings** → **Messaging API** → **Enable Messaging API**
3. Select or create a Provider, then confirm

The channel now appears in the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz).

## 2. Get Credentials

In the LINE Developers Console, open your channel:

- **Basic settings** tab → **Channel secret** → copy (→ `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET`)
- **Messaging API** tab → scroll to bottom → **Channel access token** → Issue → copy (→ `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN`)

## 3. Configure the Gateway

Add the LINE env vars to your gateway deployment:

```bash
# Docker
docker run -d --name openab-gateway \
  -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="..." \
  -e LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET="your-channel-secret" \
  -e LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-channel-access-token" \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/openabdev/openab-gateway:0.3.0

# Kubernetes
kubectl set env deployment/openab-gateway \
  LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET="your-channel-secret" \
  LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-channel-access-token"
```

## 4. Set the Webhook URL

In the LINE Developers Console → **Messaging API** tab:

1. **Webhook URL** → Edit → enter: `https://gw.yourdomain.com/webhook/line`
2. **Use webhook** → ON
3. **Auto-reply messages** → OFF (prevents LINE's default auto-reply from interfering)
4. Click **Verify** to test the connection

## 5. Configure OAB

```toml
[gateway]
url = "ws://openab-gateway:8080/ws"
platform = "line"
# allowed_users = ["U1234567890abcdef"]   # restrict to specific LINE user IDs
# allowed_channels = ["C1234567890abcdef"] # restrict to specific chat/group IDs

[agent]
```

> **Tip:** To find a LINE user ID, check the gateway logs — the sender ID is logged for each incoming message. By default all users and channels are allowed. Setting `allowed_users` or `allowed_channels` automatically restricts access to only those listed.

### User Trust (`[line]` section)

> **Mode scoping:** the `[line]` section applies when the LINE adapter is **embedded in the OAB binary** (unified mode, `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` env set on the OAB container). In the standalone-gateway mode shown above, trust is enforced by `[gateway].allow_all_users` / `allowed_users` instead — the `[line]` section has no effect on that path yet (Phase 1c consolidates the two).

Identity trust defaults to **deny-all** (identity-trust-none ADR): unknown senders are rejected until explicitly admitted. Configure trust with a first-class `[line]` section:

```toml
[line]
allowed_users = ["U1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef"]  # LINE user IDs (U…, 33 chars)
# allow_all_users = true   # explicit opt-in only — any user can drive the agent
```

Each field falls back to its `LINE_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` / `LINE_ALLOWED_USERS` env var when unset. This replaces the uniform `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` / `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS` env vars for LINE:

> ⚠️ **Deprecated:** driving LINE trust through `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` / `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS` still works but logs a startup warning; it will become a startup error in a later phase. Migrate to `[line]` (or `LINE_*` env vars).

## 6. Add the Bot as Friend

In the LINE Developers Console → **Messaging API** tab → scan the QR code with your LINE app, or search for the bot by its LINE ID.

## Features

### Supported

- **1:1 chat** — send a message to the bot, get an AI agent response
- **Inbound voice messages in 1:1 chat** — LINE-hosted audio messages are downloaded through the LINE Content API and forwarded to OpenAB as `audio` attachments, so the existing STT flow can transcribe them. This requires `[stt] enabled = true` in OpenAB core. See [STT (Speech-to-Text)](stt.md).
- **Group chat** — add the bot to a group; it responds only when @-mentioned (see @mention gating below)
- **Inbound images** — user-sent LINE images are downloaded through the LINE Content API and forwarded to OpenAB as image attachments
- **Webhook signature validation** — HMAC-SHA256 via `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET`

> **Implementation tradeoff:** OpenAB now acknowledges LINE webhooks before image download/processing so slow attachment work is less likely to trigger webhook redelivery. The follow-up image download and event emission happen asynchronously, which keeps the request path short but also means a crash after the HTTP 200 can still lose that in-flight work. This PR intentionally keeps scope small and does not add a separate background-task durability or duplicate-suppression layer on top of early-ack.
> Because image processing now happens after the ACK, an earlier image webhook can also reach OpenAB after a later text webhook from the same chat if the image path is slower.
> OpenAB now also caps how many LINE payloads can enter that post-ACK path concurrently; once the cap is full, new webhooks wait for capacity instead of creating unbounded background backlog.
> If a LINE-hosted image cannot be downloaded or decoded, OpenAB logs and skips that image event rather than synthesizing a fake text prompt.

### Not Supported (LINE API limitations)

- **Threads** — LINE has no thread/topic concept. All messages in a chat share one agent session.
- **Reactions** — LINE Bot API does not support message reactions.
- **@mention gating** — Supported (zero-config). In group/room chats the gateway only forwards messages where the bot is explicitly @-mentioned (LINE's native `mentionees[].isSelf` signal). 1:1 DMs are always forwarded. No env var is needed.
  - *Limitation — non-text messages*: LINE only attaches mention data to text messages. Images, videos, stickers, files, and location messages in groups are silently dropped because they cannot carry an @-mention.
  - *Limitation — group voice messages*: LINE voice/audio messages in groups and rooms are also dropped today because audio messages do not carry mention metadata. This PR only enables inbound voice STT for 1:1 chats.
  - *Limitation — `@All`*: A group-wide `@All` mention does **not** trigger the bot; only a direct `@BotName` mention does.
  - *Breaking change*: This gating is always active. Deployments that previously relied on the bot responding to all group messages will need to @-mention the bot after upgrading.
- **Markdown rendering** — LINE uses its own text formatting. Agent replies are sent as plain text.
- **External-content images** — LINE image messages backed by `contentProvider.type = "external"` are not downloaded yet.
- **External-content audio** — LINE audio messages backed by `contentProvider.type = "external"` are not downloaded yet.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` | Yes | Channel secret for webhook signature validation |
| `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Yes | Channel access token for Reply/Push Message API and LINE-hosted image/audio downloads |
| `LINE_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | No | `true` = any user may interact. Fallback for `[line].allow_all_users`; default deny-all |
| `LINE_ALLOWED_USERS` | No | Comma-separated LINE user IDs. Fallback for `[line].allowed_users` |

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond:**
- Verify webhook URL is correct and shows ✅ in LINE Developers Console
- Check **Use webhook** is ON and **Auto-reply messages** is OFF
- Check gateway logs: `kubectl logs -l app=openab-gateway`

**Voice message doesn't transcribe:**
- Confirm you sent the voice message in a **1:1 chat**, not a group or room
- Confirm `[stt] enabled = true` in your OpenAB config
- Confirm the STT provider is configured correctly; see [STT (Speech-to-Text)](stt.md)
- Check gateway logs for `media stored` and OpenAB logs for downstream dispatch

**"Invalid signature" in gateway logs:**
- Verify `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` matches the value in LINE Developers Console
- Make sure you're using the Channel secret (not the Channel access token)

**Webhook verify fails:**
- Ensure the gateway is reachable at the webhook URL
- Check `curl https://your-gateway-host/health` returns `ok`
